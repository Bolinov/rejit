    <h1>Benchmarks</h1>
    <p>
    Benchmark results in this page present performance to search for all
    (left-most longest) matches of a regular expression in a text.
    <br />
    Performance is reported in bytes per second (size of the text matched
    divided by the time to process it). This can be seen as the speed at which
    files of a given size can be processed. It is easier to report and understand
    than a delay close to zero.
    <br />
    Benchmarks in this page deal with texts with a rather low density of
    matches. An example representative use case would be grepping through files.

    <br /><br />
    I did not spend much time working on the benchmarks, so there is certainly
    room from improvement. A few notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Runs for different text sizes and engines are independent and use
      different randomly generated texts.</li>
      <li>The number of iterations is kept small to not increase the run time
      too much.</li>
      <li>'best' performance graphs don't take the compilation time into
      account.  'worst' performance graphs show performance for 1 run and 1
      compilation.  'amortised' performance graphs show performance for 1
      compilation and 100 runs. (except for v8. See below.)</li>
      <li>v8 results should be interpreted with caution. Performance for
      benchmarks 4 and 5 is surprising when comparing with performance for
      benchmarks 0, 1, and 2. I have not investigated.</li>
      <li>Javascript Date precision is in milliseconds. To keep decently precise
      perfomance figures the number of iterations is multiplied by 200 for text
      sizes strictly smaller than 128KiB.</li>
      <li>Benchmarks showing performance of full regexp matching (does the
      regexp match the entire string?) are not presented. Rejit should behave
      relatively well, but very little optimization work has gone there.  </li>
    </ul>
    Note that other sample programs included in the sources (regexdna and jrep)
    can be used for benchmarking.
    <br /><br />
    Finally before showing some graphs, here are a few of things rejit is
    still lacking:
    <ul>
      <li>Many features are missing (submatches, case insensitive match, etc.).
      <li>The choice of the ff element could be improved.</li>
      <li>The handling of <code>.*</code> is very poor. Example slow regexp:
      <code>.*$</code> .</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
