Search for a simple concatenation of characters.

Starting character 'a' is <b>not</b> present in the text searched.

Re2 uses memchr() to look for the starting character.
Its speed is particularly good when the C library provides a SIMD optimized memchr().
The absence of the starting character in the text matched allows re2 to stay in
the memchr() loop, yielding excellent performances.
<br />
Rejit generates custom code and uses SSE4.2 when available.
<br />
Note that rejit is able to dynamically determine the availability of the CPU
features (here SSE4.2), and so can use it even if the C library does not.  If
rejit strongly outperforms re2 on this benchmarks, it is likely that the C
library does not provide a SIMD optimized memchr(). If re2 strongly outperforms
rejit, it is likely that your library provides a SIMD memchr(), but that your
CPU does not support SSE4.2. Support for previous SSE versions may come later.
