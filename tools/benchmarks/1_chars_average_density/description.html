(1) <b>Regexp:</b> <code>abcdefg</code>
<br />
Same as before, except that the text to match is composed of random (equally
probable) characters in the range [0-z].
<br />
Here both engines suffer a performance drop from the higher density of potential
matches.
<br />
The higher density of potential matches forces the engines to leave their
optimized loop more often. (For example re2 exits memchr() when it finds the
leading character 'a').
<br />
The custom code generated by rejit uses tighter checks that allow to exit the
optimized loop less often, so performance does not degrade as much.
<br /><br />
<a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">Perf</a> traces of
re2's execution on this benchmark, the previous, and the following, are very
interesting.
