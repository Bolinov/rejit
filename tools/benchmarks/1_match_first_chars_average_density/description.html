<b>Regexp:</b> <code>abcdefg#</code>
<br />
Same as before, except that the text to match is composed of random (equally
probable) characters in the range [0-z].
<br />
Here both engines suffer a performance drop from the higher density of potential
matches.
The higher density of potential matches forces the engines to leave their
optimized loop more often. (For example re2 exits memchr() when it finds the
leading character 'a').
<br />
Rejit uses custom code with tighter checks that allows to exit the optimized
loop less often. So performance does not degrade as much. There is still room
for improvement.
