This illustrate the "fast forward" mechanism used in rejit.
<br />
With this mechanism, the matching performance of a regexp will be similar to the
matching performance of its dominating element chosen by the fast forward
mechanism (exceptions exist for yet unhandled cases like <code>.*</code>). This holds as long as the complexity of the regular expression does
not overpower the fast forward performances, which can happen when matching a
complex regexp in a text with a high density of (potential) matches.
