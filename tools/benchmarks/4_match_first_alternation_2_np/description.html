4 - <b>Regexp:</b> <code>(abcd---#|efgh___#)</code>
<br />
Search for an alternation of two words with no substring in common.
<br/>
Rejit has basic SIMD support for this, which still needs optimising. Eventually
I think the performance could look like <code>(perf for a single string)/(n of
  alternated strings)</code>
