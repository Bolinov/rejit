<br /><b>Regexp:</b> <code>(abcd---#|abcd___#)</code>
<br />
Search for an alternation of two words sharing a common prefix.<br />
The character '#' is not present in the text searched to ensure there is no
match. We cannot use a trailing '$' because rejit would use it as the fast
forward element.
<br />
Following benchmarks containing '#' use the same trick.
<br />
Re2 spots the common prefix and uses memchr() to speed up the search.
Rejit does not do that yet.
