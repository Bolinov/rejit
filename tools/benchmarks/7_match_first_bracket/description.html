<b>Regexp:</b> <code>[aAzZ0-9](#|$)</code>
<br />
Performance when searching for a bracket expression.
<br />
The sub-regexp '(#|$)' is a trick to make rejit's fast forward mechanisms chose
the bracket expression as its ffelement.
<br />
Rejt generates awful code for bracket expressions, making them really slow.
Thre is a lot of work for those, including SIMD support.
